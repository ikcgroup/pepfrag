# Installation

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

Installation is currently a manual process; we will seek to publish the package to
PyPI in the near future for easier install.

### Compatibility

`pepfrag` is written using Python 3 and should be compatible with most 
operating systems. The package has been tested on
- Windows 10
- MacOS 10.15

Because `pepfrag` includes C/C++ extensions, installation requires the 
presence of a C++ 11 compatible compiler on your machine.

### Instructions

1. Install Python 3 (>= version 3.6).
2. [Get the latest release](https://github.com/ikcgroup/rPTMValidation/releases) and 
unzip `pepfrag`.
4. Navigate to the unzipped `pepfrag` directory and execute 
`python setup.py install` to compile the C/C++ extensions and install the
`pepfrag` library in your Python packages.

# Usage

### `Peptide` Construction

`pepfrag` provides one key public class: `Peptide`. This class includes public methods
for computing the mono/average mass of the peptide, including any configured modifications
(`ModSite`s), and the peptide fragment ions, with configurable neutral losses.

A `Peptide` can be constructed from its amino acid sequence, charge state and modifications,
for example:
```python
from pepfrag import MassType, ModSite, Peptide

peptide = Peptide(
    "ABCMPK", 
    2, 
    (ModSite(15.994915, 4, "Oxidation"), ModSite(304.20536, "nterm", "iTRAQ8plex")),
    mass_type=MassType.mono
)
```

`Peptide` modifications are defined using a sequence of `ModSite` instances, which
are `namedtuples` defined by the mass of the modification (float), the site of the
modification (string for terminal modifications or 1-indexed integer otherwise) and
the name of the modification.

The `Peptide` constructor has two keyword parameters:
- `mass_type`:
    - Description: The type of mass to calculate.
    - Type: `MassType` enumeration.
    - Default: `MassType.mono`.
- `radical`:
    - Description: Flag indicating whether radical cation fragments should be 
    generated.
    - Type: bool.
    - Default: `False`.
    
### Fragment Generation
    
Fragment ions can be generated using the `fragment` method; for efficiency when the
same `Peptide` instance is used repeatedly, the resulting fragments are cached on the
instance. This cache is invalidated if the instance attributes are changed.

The `fragment` method has two keyword parameters:
- `ion_types`:
    - Description: The types of fragment ion species to generate. The default
    setup would generate precursor, immonium, b, y, a, c and z ions.
    - Type: dictionary mapping `IonType` values to possible neutral loss species.
    - Default: 
    ```python
  from pepfrag import IonType

  DEFAULT_IONS = {
        IonType.precursor.value: ["H2O", "NH3", "CO2"],
        IonType.imm.value: [],
        IonType.b.value: ["H2O", "NH3", "CO"],
        IonType.y.value: ["NH3", "H2O"],
        IonType.a.value: [],
        IonType.c.value: [],
        IonType.z.value: []
  }
    ```
- `force`:
    - Description: Flag indicating whether fragments should be forcibly regenerated,
    *i.e.* bypassing the cached ions.
    - Type: bool.
    - Default: `False`.
